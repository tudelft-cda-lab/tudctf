description: "My good friend Nathan Sebastian Anthony gave me this nice Dual_EC_DRBG-like random number generator. It uses elliptic curves so it must be very secure. Nathan was even kind enough to provide me with the necessary P and Q points, so that I don't have to calculate them myself. What a nice guy!"
