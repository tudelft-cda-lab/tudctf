This challenge relies on P being a multiple of Q (such that Q * e = P). In this case, e = 42 (small enough to be bruteforceable).

s = internal state

to generate a number:
- calculate output = s*Q and take its x
- calculate next internal state = s*P and take its x

to crack:
- if you have an output number (x of a point), calculate its corresponding y
- (x, y) = s*Q
- next internal state = s*P
- this is equal to s*(e*Q) = e*(s*Q)
- multiply (x, y) by e in order to get the next internal state
- from there, you can predict the following generated numbers
